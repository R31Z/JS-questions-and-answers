## 1. What happens when you don’t declare a variable in Javascript?

If you don’t explicitly declare a variable, you risk creating an implied global variable. This is a problem, as you will be unable to create multiple instances of that object, as each new instance will overwrite the data from the last.
In general, global variables should be used only in very specific situations and are typically not recommended, as they can lead to a lot of odd side effects that may be difficult to track down.

## 2. What will the code below output? Explain your answer.

  console.log(0.1 + 0.2); 
  
  console.log(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3);
  
An educated answer to this question would simply be: “You can’t be sure. it might print out “0.3” and “true”, or it might not. 
Numbers in JavaScript are all treated with floating point precision, and as such, may not always yield the expected results.” 
The example provided above is classic case that demonstrates this issue. 

Surprisingly, it will print out:
0.30000000000000004 false
